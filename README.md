Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e PowerBI Monster Analysis

This project seeks to analyze all monsters in Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition, looking speicifally at Monster Type, Moral Alignment, Source Material, Challenge Rating, and Biome. 

The main dashboard is comprised of visualizations showing how each of the above categories stack up in terms of the categorical totals. 

The Challege Rating and Source dashboards give a more detailed look into the categories of the same name.

Finally, the monster summoner tab allows for selections of numerous combinations of the different categories for a given monster using the slicers, and returns only the monsters that have the selected attributes.
